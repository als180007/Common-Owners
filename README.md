For this to work:
1. Create an infura.io account
2. Create an ethereum project
3. Get a url
4. Download Python
5. Install pip
6. Install pip on MacOS: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-install-pip-in-macos/
7. Install pip on Windows: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-install-pip-on-windows/
8. Install libraries: (Open Command Prompt on Windows or Terminal on Mac and type the following 2 lines:)
9. pip install web3
10. pip install pandas
11. Save the 3 other files in this folder that end in .py (make sure to save in the same folder)
12. Download a text editor (something like Sublime would do)
13. Edit line 4 of infura.py to include your infura url from step 3. Should look like: 
infura_url = 'PUT YOUR URL HERE'
14. Save the files
15. Run main.py (ctrl-shift-b in Sublime)
16. It will take a while to complete (will show updates every 100 NFTs processed)
17. You should end up with an excel file containing addresses of all witch owners and ape owners
18. My ridiculous thing for today is to include a Meow in the README
